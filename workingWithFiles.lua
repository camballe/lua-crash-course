   ERROR WHEN YOU HOVER OVER 'anotherFile':

local anotherFile: file*? {
    close: function,

}

EXPLANATION:

The error you're encountering is a static analysis warning from your Lua development environment. The warning is indicating that the anotherFile variable may be nil at the point where you are calling methods on it, and it's suggesting that you perform a nil-check to avoid potential issues.

In your code, the file may not be opened successfully (e.g., the file doesn't exist, or there's a permission issue), and in that case, io.open would return nil. To address this, you can add a check to ensure that the file is opened successfully before attempting to perform operations on it.

Here's an example:

local anotherFile = io.open("anotherFile.txt", "r")

if anotherFile then
    local reads = anotherFile:read("*line")
    anotherFile:close()
    print(reads)
else
    print("Failed to open the file.")
end


In this modified code, a check is added to verify that anotherFile is not nil before proceeding with reading and printing. If the file opening fails, it prints an error message. This helps prevent potential runtime errors that may occur if you try to operate on a nil file object.
